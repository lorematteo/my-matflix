## ðŸŽ¯Â Introduction and Objectives of the project
The primary objective was to produce a functional prototype of the Netflix website to showcase its feasibility and potential for future development. Working independently, I dedicated effort to ensure the application's ease of use, visual appeal, and integration of essential features like user authentication, a personalized movie list, and an admin panel.

The application offers users a convenient entertainment experience, featuring effortless access to diverse genres of movies and TV shows. The My List functionality functions effectively, enabling users to curate their custom lists of movies. The user interface is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly. In summary, I believe that this Netflix clone stands as a robust proof of concept for a streaming platform, achieved through solo development efforts.

> In adherence to legal standards, this website exclusively features movie trailers and refrains from utilizing any unlawfully acquired content to ensure compliance with copyright regulations.
